    <P>
      My name is <b>Jenn Hsiang</b>, a student of the Interactive Media Design Program. Prior to taking the
      <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design"> IMD </abbr>Program, I was graduated from the
      English for<abbr title=" English for Academic Purpose Program "> EAP </abbr>. I canâ€™t describe how exciting I am
      now to learning this Program. Not only because <em>online
        business</em> is already a trend to everyone, but learn how to code/develop along with
      <abbr title="Responsive Web Design"> RWD</abbr> can be efficient and productive in the
      future.

      Speaking of hobby, it is broad. Mostly, activities that I love doing in
      the summer are <em>golfing</em>, <em>boat-fishing</em>, and <em>gardening</em>. I always believe
      Summer is the most beautiful and wonderful season in Canada even only lasts for few months. In the
      winter, <em>skiing</em> could be my best option. I have never tried <em> Ice-fishing</em> as it has
      been on my bucket list for years but would like to try it out this year if possible.
